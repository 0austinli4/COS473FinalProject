 ChatGPT Revisions(to see newly written file, look at gpt1.sol): 
Updated:**
The issue in the original code was specifically in the `vote` function where the points given to the contenders were different than expected by the Certora specification. The correction was made in the `vote` function, specifically the points given to the contenders in the `voteTo` function:

- Changed the points given to the second choice contender from 3 to 2 in the `vote` function.
- Changed the points given to the third choice contender from 3 to 1 in the `vote` function.

By updating the points given to the contenders in the `vote` function as stated above, the `correctPointsIncreaseToContenders` rule is now satisfied.
